            a graduate student in the anthropology department. I study bioethics, genomics, and Indigenous communities —
            Indigenous inclusion in science in general and the intersection between pharmaceuticals and genetics.

        <strong>DP:</strong> What were some moments when you felt like your Native identity stood out the most?
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-right">
        <strong>NC:</strong> It’s always present to me that I am Indigenous. A lot of society and a lot of my
        interactions are framed in opposition to something that is not necessarily by my choice. Being Indigenous and
        going through society, you are constantly thought of as less or incapable. I think it is a blessing to be
        Indigenous and to be in spaces that were not meant for me and to navigate them in a way that we’ve always been
        capable of doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>DP:</strong> What’s a message you have for other Native students at Princeton?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-right">
        <strong>NC:</strong> Be unapologetically Indigenous. I think there’s a lot of fear around being vocally
        Indigenous in classes and research in politics broadly. And we’ll never get the foothold that we need to support
        other Natives if we’re quiet when we should be supported.

        <strong>DP:</strong> What's the significance of your red protest t-shirt?
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-right">
        <strong>LB:</strong> It refers to Mauna Kea and the plans for a thirty-meter telescope to be built on it. Mauna
        Kea (Mauna a Wakea) is linked to the name of Wakea, the father of the Hawaiian islands. Thus, it is very sacred
        and important to Hawaiian culture. Many Native Hawaiians believe that a telescope on top of Mauna Kea would
        desecrate the sacred land, especially when there have been multiple instances of mismanagement from other
        research projects on Mauna Kea, dating back to 1998. I feel like people may expect me to be in support of the
        thirty-meter telescope being built, as I am majoring in civil engineering here. However, I believe that
        respecting the land and the Earth, as well as the people who live on it, is far more important than the
        scientific discovery of faraway stars.

      <p>
        <strong>The Daily Princetonian:</strong> Can you describe your Indigenous identity?
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-right">
        <strong>Rodrigo Córdova Rosado:</strong> Through my grandmother, I’m a citizen of the Osage Nation, Oklahoma.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>DP:</strong> You brought your moccasins with you today. What’s the significance of them to you, in terms
        of Native culture or for the Osage?
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-right">
        <strong>RCR:</strong> For the Osage, like most of the Plains tribes, it’s just about … they’re just shoes.
        They’re just shoes, but I have really come to appreciate them. To an extent it does connect you to an artistry
        and an artisanship of one side of my heritage, and getting to appreciate that through the walk of every day
        really comes to be pretty nice.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>DP:</strong> What’s one thing you want Princeton to learn, as a community, about what it means to be
        Native?
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-right">
        <strong>RCR:</strong> To be Indigenous is a pretty serious claim about what the nature of our relationship as
        people is, not only to the land, but to the past and in America as a whole. The past is present in a lot of
        ways. There are these consequences that I think we live through today by the nature of how reservations have
        much lower access to health care funding compared to Medicare, compared to other social welfare programs; the
        way that communities still don’t have the same access to education to see themselves in a fast changing world.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>DP:</strong> Do you think it is students’ responsibility to learn about Indigenous culture and the land
        they’re inhabiting?
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-right">
        <strong>RCR:</strong> It’s certainly not their fault in any way, shape, or form, that they don’t know about
        these things. But it is, I think, a sadness that so few of us know about the history of the continent known as
        the Americas before the Europeans got here. I think it’s unfortunate that we have not cultivated a curiosity for
        learning the history of the land that we consider our right when the history is a little bit more complicated
        than that.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>DP</strong>: You’re part of Natives of Princeton ... What is the role of that community in your life
        here?
      </p>
      <p data-aos="fade-right">
        <strong>RCR:</strong> So far, my relationship with Princeton has been one of connecting with a community that I
        didn’t have access to when I was in the UK, and a community that I didn’t really have access to when I was in
        Puerto Rico. I guess it’s been quite nice to see students who are thinking through these ideas of, “what does
        indigeneity mean in a world that is predominantly not learning about Indigenous people?” Being this voice of,
        “What does it mean to be this body within a system that doesn’t necessarily care about me or doesn’t necessarily
        know about this part of me?” has been an interesting twist of my life. Going from interrogating these questions
        personally and without many answers, to now trying to facilitate those questions for others.
